# DeepSeek Monitor Windows

[简体中文](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

DeepSeek Monitor Windows is a desktop application for monitoring DeepSeek API usage on Windows. It displays the account balance, monthly spending, model token usage, and recent usage trends.

This project is a Windows adaptation inspired by the open-source project [JayHome137/DeepSeekMonitor](https://github.com/JayHome137/DeepSeekMonitor). **Many thanks to JayHome137 for the original open-source work.** The original project is a macOS menu bar and desktop widget application built with Swift, SwiftUI, AppKit, and WidgetKit. It monitors DeepSeek V4 Flash / Pro balances, token usage, and spending. This project reimplements the application with a Windows-specific technology stack and workflow.

Important: This project is not an official DeepSeek product.

## Features

- Queries the DeepSeek API account balance through the official balance endpoint.
- Retrieves DeepSeek platform usage data, including monthly spending, total model tokens, request count, cache hits, cache misses, and output tokens.
- Displays usage for V4 Flash and V4 Pro.
- Provides a seven-day spending trend chart and model detail pages.
- Adds a Windows system tray icon while keeping the main window off the taskbar by default.
- Saves, clears, and validates the API key.
- Supports automatic usage token retrieval with manual paste as a fallback.
- Adapts the visual design of the original macOS version to a Windows Tauri window.

## Download and Install

Users can download and run `DeepSeekMonitorWindows_1.1.0_x64-setup.exe` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Joyi-code/DeepSeekMonitorWindows/releases/latest). You do not need to uninstall an older version before installing an update.

Installer SHA256: `B13EF28BB7E803D923E1A00BCE4A873B4EB7F2F592AFF690173C2E9291F1D13F`.

Runtime requirements:

- Windows 10 or Windows 11.
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime. It is generally included with Windows 11. Install it separately on Windows 10 if it is missing.

## Source Development

Development requirements:

- Node.js 18 or later and npm.
- Rust 1.77.2 or later. The MSVC toolchain is recommended.
- Visual Studio Build Tools with the Desktop development with C++ workload.

Source development on Windows requires Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 with the Desktop development with C++ workload. `npm run tauri:dev` and `npm run tauri:check` automatically detect the local Visual Studio Build Tools installation, so no fixed path needs to be configured manually. Before running `npx tauri build`, make sure the Rust MSVC toolchain is available in the current terminal.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Joyi-code/DeepSeekMonitorWindows.git
cd DeepSeekMonitorWindows
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

Run development checks:

```powershell
npm run tauri:check
```

Build the installer:

```powershell
npx tauri build
```

The current Tauri bundle target is an NSIS installer. Build artifacts are generated in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/nsis/`.

If you see `Visual Studio Build Tools not found`, install Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 and verify that the Desktop development with C++ workload is selected.

## Usage

Open the application and go to Settings to configure your DeepSeek API key. The API key is used to query the account balance and is available from the API Keys page on the DeepSeek platform.

The current application interface is in Simplified Chinese. The button labels below match the text shown in the application.

DeepSeek does not currently document a public API endpoint for account-level usage statistics. Usage statistics therefore require a usage token obtained through a DeepSeek web login. This token differs from the API key and is used to access the DeepSeek platform usage endpoint.

Method 1: automatic synchronization through web login

- Click `网页登录自动同步`.
- Sign in through the DeepSeek login window.
- After a successful login, the application attempts to extract the usage token from the WebView2 cache.
- After synchronization succeeds, the application automatically refreshes monthly spending and token statistics.

Method 2: manually paste the usage token

- Click `方式二：手动粘贴 token`.
- Follow the on-screen instructions and retrieve `JSON.parse(localStorage.userToken).value` from the browser console.
- Paste and save the token. This method serves as a fallback when automatic synchronization fails.

**The usage token may expire and should be treated as a sensitive session credential. If a usage query fails, repeat the web login synchronization or paste the token again. On a shared computer, clear it with `清除 Token` in Settings after use.**

## Data Storage

The application configuration is stored by default at:

```text
%APPDATA%\DeepSeekMonitorWindows\config.json
```

This file stores the API key and usage token as unencrypted text. **Do not commit, share, or back up this file. Do not expose credentials in screenshots, logs, or configuration files. On a shared computer, clear the API key and usage token in Settings after use.**

The WebView2 login cache is usually stored at:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\com.deepseek.monitor.windows\EBWebView
```

This directory contains local runtime data and should not be committed to the repository.

## Changelog

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Joyi-code/DeepSeekMonitorWindows/releases) for the complete release history.

### v1.1.0

- Added detailed cache hit, cache miss, and output token statistics.
- Added a light UI theme that can be toggled from the dashboard and persists across sessions.
- Added the current version number to the Settings page.
- GitHub Release `v1.1.0` is marked as Latest. The installer is `DeepSeekMonitorWindows_1.1.0_x64-setup.exe`.
- Installer SHA256: `B13EF28BB7E803D923E1A00BCE4A873B4EB7F2F592AFF690173C2E9291F1D13F`.
- The historical `v1.0.1` release and its installer remain available for rollback and version tracking.

### v1.0.1

- Fixed an issue that allowed multiple application instances to run at the same time. Thanks to Zhuyin from the Douyin community for reporting the bug. Previously, double-clicking the application icon or executable while the application was already running created another process. The `tauri-plugin-single-instance` guard now brings the existing dashboard to the foreground instead of opening another instance.

### v1.0.0

- First stable release with DeepSeek API balance queries, platform usage statistics, spending trends, a Windows system tray entry, and API key and usage token management.
